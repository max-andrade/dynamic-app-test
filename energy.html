From Traditional to Modern Smart Grid
 
•	Traditional Electrical Grid
•	A traditional power grid is an interconnected network of transmission and distribution systems comprising substations, feeders, transformers, power lines, switches, protection devices, meters, and other circuit elements. 
•	It is characterized by a unidirectional flow of electricity from the production point to the utilization points, with limited controls.
 
•	Modern Smart Grid
•	The modern smart grid is a highly automated system comprising distributed energy resource (DER) generation, transmission, and distribution. 
•	It is characterized by a bidirectional flow of electricity and data from power systems.
•	What makes it different from a traditional power grid is that it monitors the state of the network, responds to control commands to adapt itself to variable loads and demand, and tends to auto-correct abnormal network conditions.
 
 
Definition of a Smart Grid
 
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST):

Substation Automation
 
Substation automation refers to the use of advanced technologies and communication systems to monitor, control, and manage various substation functions remotely. It enhances the efficiency, reliability, and flexibility of substation operations.
Components
•	Remote Terminal Units (RTU's): These are devices that collect data from sensors and control equipment within the substation and transmit it to a central control center.

•	Improved maintenance and asset management
•	Enhanced situational awareness
 
Protection Systems
 
Protection systems are designed to detect and isolate faults or abnormal conditions in the power system to prevent equipment damage, power outages, and electrical hazards. These systems use protective relays and associated equipment.
Components
•	Protective Relays: These devices monitor current, voltage, and other parameters and trip circuit breakers or other devices when they detect abnormalities.
•	Circuit Breakers: These devices are responsible for interrupting the flow of electrical current when a fault is detected.
•	Current and Voltage Transformers: These transformers provide scaled-down versions of current and voltage signals to relays for protection functions.

•	Earlier, substation automation and substation protection & control systems were often not fully integrated.
•	Today, installation of Remote Terminal Units (RTU's), integrated with a central SCADA / EMS (Energy Management System) and / or WAMPACS (Wide Area Monitoring, Protection and Control Systems), has led to a fully automated Transmission and Distribution substations.
•	Traditional Distribution substations were rarely connected to a central SCADA system. With increased digitalization, modern substations can collect network data from protection and control relays, and central SCADA for remote visualization and control of the Distribution network. 
•	Today, smart grid applications have become increasingly data-driven, taking advantage of real-time and time-series data acquired from a fully integrated substation automation systems.
Substation Cyber-Security
 
Growing digitalization of substations with bidirectional data flow across multiple channels, from network to customers, have underlined the necessity of creating a robust cyber security system, in compliance with the regulations to protect the critical national infrastructure. Cyber-security layer, with multi-factor authentication (MFA) is integrated into the smart substation automation application for secure access by authorized users, as per governing standards. 
NERC Critical Infrastructure Protection (NERC CIP) has set the standards to secure the critical assets of North America's bulk electric system. Other global standards widely adopted for substation automation, protection and security are those set by IEEE and IEC. For example, IEC 61850 is the de-facto standard for substation control system communication with Intelligent Electronic Devices (IED) on the network.
 
 
Active Network Management
 
 
Key Features of Active Network Management (ANM)
•	bullet
An ANM system continuously monitors all the constraints on an area of the network, in real-time, and allocates optimal capacity to customers, without causing grid stress, overloading or loss of power quality. 
•	bullet
Optimizing the network through ANM offers a smart grid distribution system the ability to connect more distributed generation, mainly from RE sources, in a relatively inexpensive way to meet the energy demand.
•	bullet
ANM aims to add more flexibility into the grid, and utilize the network assets more efficiently. 
•	bullet
ANM relies on a fast and reliable communication infrastructure between substations and the central Distribution Management System (DMS) - a suite of applications for automating grid operations.
 
 
Automatic Voltage Control
 
Power Distribution networks are subject to voltage variations due to continuous changes in the network load. The voltage across an electrical network changes depending on where consumers are connected and how much electricity they use. The higher the consumption, the greater the voltage drop between substation and consumer. At times of heavy load, the voltage of the downstream networks is reduced and may go below the lower limit (in the UK the voltage on the 230/400 V circuits should be maintained within +6 % and −10 %). Distribution systems are typically designed to let voltage levels vary within acceptable limits as consumer load varies – voltage levels approach the statutory minimum when loads are maximum, and statutory maximum when loads are minimum. 
Automatic Voltage Control (AVC) is about putting intelligence into the substations to monitor voltage levels within the Low Voltage (LV) network and automatically adjust controls to maintain the voltage level within preset limits. AVC can improve both the efficiency and power quality of the distribution network. AVC has to get smarter to cope well with the reverse power flow conditions arising from distributed generation connecting to the network.
Traditionally, an automatic On-Load Tap Changer (OLTC) in coordination with a diverter switch and an AVC relay are used on the Distribution transformers to maintain the voltages on distribution circuits within limits. 
 
 
Dynamic Line Rating
 
The conventional approach to network planning and operation is to operate distribution lines within static or, at best, seasonal rating limits. In truth, the maximum current an overhead line can carry safely is an ever-changing value affected by prevailing weather conditions. 
Dynamic Line Rating (DLR) is about squeezing more capacity out of existing network through real-time monitoring. DLR is the ability to vary the thermal capacity of an overhead Transmission or Distribution (T&D) power line dynamically in real time, depending on the varying environmental conditions (ambient temperature, solar radiation, wind speed and direction).

 
DLR aims to increase the ampacity / current rating of the T&D lines, based on thermal limits, mitigate grid congestion and improve prospects of Variable Renewable Energy (VRE) integration into the grid. Both heating and cooling of the overhead line can affect its thermal capacity with a downward and upward variation in capacity, respectively. A line’s thermal capacity will be higher, for example, when it is cooled by wind or when the temperature drops, allowing more electricity to flow through the line.
DLR offers system operators a rapidly deployable, low-cost method of increasing line ratings, which can be implemented without the need to build new physical infrastructure or put key lines out of service. By measuring line parameters and weather conditions, DLR can help determine the current capacity (ampacity) of the network at any given time and help achieve peak network performance.
 
Benefits That DLR Offers to the Power System
 
•	bullet
It reduces congestion in the power system, optimizes asset utilization in a safe manner, results in additional income from existing power generation assets, improves cost efficiency of the lines and avoids investment in new lines.
•	bullet
All these can result in lower prices for consumers, faster integration of distributed energy resources and efficient VRE integration with the power systems.
•	bullet
DLR can contribute to overall system planning, forecast the power-carrying capacity and enhance grid resilience, which is key to maintaining security of supply.
 
Distributed Generation
 
 
•	bullet
It is typically a small-scale electric power source embedded in the distribution network.
•	bullet
In contrast to the traditional model in which energy generation and delivery originates at a central plant, DG is situated close to the consumers it supplies.
•	bullet
Being close to the load, a DG system cuts down on transmission and distribution losses.
•	bullet
DG includes a broad range of renewables (wind, solar, hydro), low carbon energy storage, and Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants. At its smallest scale, it can include microgeneration.
 
 
•	bullet
If unharnessed, DG can cause problems with voltage levels, voltage fluctuations, thermal ratings and power flows, but if controlled, it can be a valuable tool for balancing the network.
•	bullet
With rise in power distribution automation, the prospects of more DG connections have risen too.
•	bullet
The connection and management of distributed generation have marked a shift from passive to active network management.
•	bullet
Active network management makes the connection of additional distributed generation more efficient and cost-effective.
 
Demand Response Management
 
One way to de-carbonize the heating and transportation sectors is through electrification, for example, the increased utilization of heat pumps and plug-in electric vehicles. However, the immediate consequence is the increase in electricity load causing potentially serious operational problems to both distribution and generation systems. Load control or load management is an
age-old concept in power system operation.
Demand Response (DR) or Demand-Side Management (DSM) is a systematic way of managing loads. Demand Response Management (DRM) describes a set of strategies used in competitive electricity markets to increase the participation of customers in exercising their choice of energy sources of supply, and energy end use (consumption pattern).

•	bullet
Home Automation: Domestic appliances can be controlled in an intelligent way, aided by smart metering, to bring more flexibility in energy consumption.
 
Demand-Side Integration (DSI)
 
Demand-Side Integration (DSI) refers to the integration of the energy supply sources, the electric power system, and the end-user load. When customers are exposed to market prices, they may respond, for example, by shifting load from the peak to the off-peak period, or by reducing their load during peak hours.
 
Grid Energy Storage
 
Storing electricity in large volumes is very difficult, so generation and demand need to be matched in real time.
Grid energy storage technologies include:
•	bullet
Batteries, which are expensive to produce, costly to maintain and have a limited lifespan.
•	bullet
Compressed air, which requires similar large scale facilities as pump storage.
•	bullet
Flywheels, which are only good for small scale storage.
•	bullet
Hydrogen, produced using off-peak electricity and then combined with oxygen in fuel cells to produce electricity at peak time but with lower efficiency than pumped storage or batteries.
•	bullet
Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES), which stores energy in the magnetic field created by a direct current flow in a cryogenically cooled superconducting coil. However, this is an expensive option.
Energy storage in power system can be divided into those whose prime function is to deliver short-term power (kW) or those supplying energy (kWh) over a longer period.
 
Power Distribution Automation
 
Electric power distribution automation allows utilities to implement flexible control of distribution systems, which can be used to enhance efficiency, reliability, and quality of electric service. Worldwide research and development efforts are focused in the areas of communication technologies and the application of IEC 61850 standards, which specify how IED's can be integrated to make distribution automation more intelligent, efficient and cost effective.
Growth in power distribution automation has helped to improve the quality and reliability of supply and allow more distributed generation to be connected to the grid seamlessly.
The connection and management of distributed generation are accelerating the shift from passive to active management of the distribution network. Network voltage changes and fault levels are increasing due to the connection of distributed generation. 
Without active management of the network, the costs of connection of distributed generation will rise and the connection of additional distributed generation may be limited.
Substation Automation, Virtualization & Edge Computing 
Substation Automation
 
As modern substations become more automated, supported by IED's, sensors and automation devices, the demand of computing power to support substation applications is also growing. 
SCADA / HMI* and communication systems require computing hardware that meets the stringent requirements of safe operation in the substation environment.
The process of virtualization is a way to create multiple virtually simulated instances over the computer hardware to utilize the system's underlying resources fully. Through virtualization, many systems can be accommodated on one platform, and complex computing can be performed more efficiently and productively. The virtualization platform allows the computing system resources, such as storage, memory, processor, etc, to be distributed among multiple virtual computers termed as Virtual Machines (VM's), running different application on each virtual machine, easing the load on the system resources and improving performance.
 
Virtualization
 
The Virtual Machine (VM) is the emulation or a virtual representation of a physical device that can execute multiple operating systems on the same computer. Cloud computing uses virtualization too. Virtualization is a foundational element of cloud computing and enables multiple users to share a single physical instance of a resource at a time.

Edge Computing
 
Edge computing refers to a new network architecture and open platform that integrates network, computing, storage and application of core capabilities at the edge of the network near the source of data acquisition. Edge computing greatly reduces the network burden and data congestion, reduces latency or network delays, can quickly respond to the user request and improve system performance.
With the rapid development of intelligent substation, the research and development of various online monitoring systems, the number of process layer devices and systems is increasing day by day. Edge computing can help in real-time monitoring of electric substation, feeders, and network assets data, and enable substation operators to detect and diagnose faults quickly, restore the network and improve reliability and power quality of supply.

Smart edge devices collect data from diverse sources, and perform advanced analytics at the point of data collection. The insights derived from edge analytics can be used to drive grid stability and safety in real time.
 
Grid Modernization
 
Cutting edge grid modernization platforms mean that utilities can manage increasingly complex distribution networks efficiently and cost effectively. Coupled with edge computing and analytics, the platform can be used to accurately forecast energy demand and facilitate changes to the grid in real-time.
In order to drive reliability and operational efficiency, utility companies need to leverage data using edge analytics.  Analytics at the edge enables utility companies to predict and prevent problems in real time, to cost-effectively deploy resources, and to increase overall grid optimization, security and reliability. One of the advantages of edge and IoT technology is that it drives the creation of 'smart’ solutions for utility companies. Smart computer vision cameras – fixed or attached to drones – with machine learning capabilities can inspect assets and run algorithms to analyze their condition.
Combining edge and IoT can help create a smart grid, enabling the utility to effectively and efficiently manage supply and demand. Cyber security at the edge can protect against cyberattacks and malware, and smart analytics can detect unwanted actions, report anomalies and trigger responses to immediately isolate unauthorized activity. 
This is all part of the overall move to digitalize the grid, which has ‘virtualization’ as its foundation. The benefits of this modernization are reduced cost, increased reliability, self-diagnostics and improved security.

Grid Operations For Low Carbon Transition
 
•	bullet
Most electricity today is produced from carbon-rich energy sources such as coal and gas.
•	bullet
To tackle global warming, there’s a general acceptance that we need to transition to low-carbon or carbon-free energy sources.
•	bullet
However, low carbon generation, such as nuclear and renewables, tends to be inherently less flexible than, for example, a gas-fired plant that can increase or decrease output at relatively short notice.
•	bullet
In the case of renewables, the challenge is even greater since they are not only inflexible but also unpredictable. Therefore, moving to low-carbon or carbon-free energy sources will require a fundamental shift in the way we use and store power.
•	bullet
The unpredictability and inflexible nature of power generated from sustainable (renewable) sources means that we need to develop more efficient energy storage systems. We also need to improve flexibility through energy efficiency and demand-side management initiatives.
•	bullet
To align demand with low-carbon generation, consumers must be aware of power availability and its cost and schedule their consumption accordingly.
Network Visibility and Demand Balancing In Grid Operations

Power Distribution Automation Application: Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)
SCADA is a critical component of power distribution automation and provides real-time information to the Distribution Management System (DMS) applications by performing the following functions:
 
*RTU: Remote Terminal Unit 
**PLC: Programmable Logic Controllers
 
 
DATA ACQUISITION

Transmission System Operations (TSO)
 
Challenges Faced By TSO
•	Transmission systems globally are encountering more demanding operating conditions due to increasing penetrations of renewable energy, bidirectional flows, and frequent cross-border electricity trading.
•	The variability of the power output from RE sources and unplanned energy flows through transmission grids are putting pressure on the system operators responsible for maintaining the system stability.
•	Excessive power flow in transmission lines and significant variations in busbar voltages during grid operations could lead to system overload, abnormal conditions, and network collapse.
Technologies Used In TSO
•	To monitor, control, and optimize the performance of generation and transmission systems, a suite of applications called the Energy Management System (EMS) is used by the Transmission System Operators.
•	Monitoring and control functions for EMS are frequently integrated with SCADA; these systems are collectively known as SCADA / EMS.
•	Transmission system operators depend on Phasor Measurement Units (PMU's) to record grid data. This data is utilized by the Wide Area Monitoring, Control and Protection System (WAMPACS) and SCADA / EMS.
 
Energy Management System (EMS)
 
•	Energy Management Systems (EMS) were originally designed at a time when the electrical power industry was vertically integrated and had centralized communications and computing systems.
•	bullet
With the deregulation of the power industry and the development of the smart grid, decision-making processes have become decentralized. This shift has led to greater automation and bidirectional flow of information within the industry.
•	bullet
To facilitate this transition, various international standards have been established or are under development to abstractly describe power systems and services. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is used to describe interfaces, providing an object-oriented representation of the power system.
•	bullet
Standardized data models are crucial in enabling the integration of applications from different vendors. Presently, the commonly used standard for EMS systems is IEC 61970.
•	bullet
System status and measurements are collected by the Remote Terminal Units (RTU's) and sent to the control centre through the communication infrastructure.
•	bullet
EMS is responsible for communication with both RTU's and Intelligent Electronic Devices (IED's). Its functionalities include applications such as topological analysis, load forecasting, power flow analysis, state estimation, and contingency analysis.
 
Wide-Area Measurement Systems (WAMS)
Wide Area Monitoring Systems (WAMS) are installed on transmission systems to supplement traditional SCADA. 
They measure the magnitudes and phase angles of busbar voltages and current flows through transmission lines to achieve the following objectives:

Power System State Estimation
–
•	Since the phasor data is synchronized, the magnitudes and phase angles of voltages at all busbars in the grid can be estimated using a state estimation algorithm. 
•	These estimates can help predict possible voltage and phase instabilities and system vulnerabilities.

Power System Monitoring and Warning
–
•	Phasor data enables real-time monitoring of power system operating conditions, assessment of system stability, and generation of warnings.

Power System Event Analysis
–
•	Synchronized phasor data of high accuracy is transmitted through Phasor Data concentrators (PDC's) to the transmission control centre. 
•	This enables system operators to study the causes and effects of faults and take countermeasures against future events.
 

WAMPACS Integration
–
•	WAMPACS takes actions to correct the system upon predicting voltage, phase angle, or frequency instability, such as switching generators and controlling devices. 
•	Examples include Flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS), Power System Stabilizers (PSS), and High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) converters.

Emergency Control Signals
–
•	WAMPACS generates emergency control signals to avoid large-scale blackouts through selective load shedding or sectionalizing of the network during faults.

Distribution System Operations (DSO)
 
•	bullet
The current electricity distribution network was designed and built for a one-way flow of electricity from large-scale centralized power stations to the consumers. 
•	bullet
The energy system is evolving to include more distributed sources of electricity generation, e.g., large commercial and community-owned solar farms, wind farms, biomass, and hydropower plants.
•	bullet
Smaller-scale electricity generation from grid-connected rooftop solar PV, micro wind turbines, or Waste-to-Energy (W2E) systems installed on commercial sites and homes allows the bidirectional flow of electricity through net-metering arrangements to account for the import and export of energy. 
•	bullet
Distributed and decentralized generation from smaller RE systems, connected at the distribution level, has led to the Distributed Network Operators (DNO) taking up the role of Distribution System Operators (DSO).
•	bullet
Smart grid technologies help the DNO's take up the DSO’s role with real-time access to data that gives them more visibility and control of the network to ensure secure and reliable grid operations.

 

•	DNO's are transforming to become DSO's with a greater focus on energy savings, efficiency, infrastructure improvement, grid flexibility, and DR / DSM services.
•	A DSO securely operates an active distribution system comprising networks, generation, variable demand, and flexible Distributed Energy Resources (DER).
•	A DSO enables competitive access to electricity markets and optimal use of DER on distribution networks to deliver secure, sustainable, and affordable supply.
DNO To DSO Transition
 
•	bullet
DNO's own and control the electricity distribution network, which connects the generators, suppliers, and energy consumers.
•	bullet
As DNO's transition to the DSO role, they can establish DER connections to the network quickly, without causing grid instabilities, ensure optimized operation, and liberate potentially unutilized capacity within the network, thus reducing the cost of expensive network upgrades and replacements.
•	bullet
By taking control of and discharging the DSO responsibility, DNO's can work more closely and collaboratively with the RE generators and energy suppliers to achieve grid decarbonization and sustainability goals.

bullet
This functional transition of a DNO becoming a DSO opens up new opportunities for businesses, communities, and homes through the provision of:
1.	Grid Balancing Services (matching energy demand with generation in real-time)
2.	Flexibility Services (ability to quickly ramp up / ramp down generation to maintain grid stability, using spinning reserves*).
3.	Energy Efficiency and Demand Side Management Services (encouraging customers to respond to DSM signals to conserve electricity and reduce their energy bills through voluntary load curtailment, load shifting and peak shaving measures, and the use of energy-efficient appliances).
•	bullet
The DSO function uses smart technologies to provide granular data, real-time network operations visibility, increased flexibility, and a more balanced energy system.
 
Comparison Between the DNO and DSO Models
 
ecessity of DNO To DSO Transition in Modern Grid Operations
 
•	bullet
Improved Network Access and Control: Connections to the network become easier and quicker due to better access, control, and monitoring of grid parameters during operations.
•	bullet
Cost Savings For Customers: DSO transition helps avoid some of the costs of expensive network upgrades often passed on to unsuspecting customers through their electricity bills, with better regulatory checks.
•	bullet
Uncovering Network Capacities: DSO transition identifies potentially unutilized network capacities through energy efficiency, demand response (DR), and DSM measures, eliminating the need for upgrades.
•	bullet
Energy Use Flexibility: DSO services can include paying consumers to use surplus energy during excess generation and rewarding them for reducing usage during peak times, enhancing energy use flexibility and grid stability.
•	bullet
Energy Storage: Customers with energy storage could benefit from additional revenue streams. For example, if a business generates electricity from solar panels,
it could store and export the solar energy later when required.
In summary, DSO functions offer better visibility of real-time network operations, increased flexibility, and a more balanced energy system. This helps reduce network upgrade costs and facilitates quicker, cost-effective network connections for customers.

Grid Balancing Services
 
•	bullet
Balancing Services are reactive short-term means to level out frequency deviations in the power grid. They are one of the ancillary services that the system operators provide to ensure a secure power supply. 
•	bullet
Balancing Services include balancing energy and balancing capacity to meet electricity demand. 
•	bullet
Balancing energy means the energy used by system operators to maintain the grid frequency. While, balancing capacity refers to a flexible capacity that the provider has agreed to keep available as a control reserve, to provide during an emergency, or to ease grid constraints during demand overshoot.  
•	bullet
A power grid must maintain a certain frequency – either 50 or 60 Hz. How much the frequency deviates from the needed value depends on the correlation of power feed-in and consumption. 
•	bullet
If the power generated is higher than the demand, the frequency increases. If the power generated is lower than the demand, the frequency decreases. Beyond a certain grid frequency deviation (typically +/- 0.2 Hz), the grid can become unstable and pose a risk of a blackout. 
•	bullet
To avoid such a scenario, the Transmission System Operators (TSO's) deploy energy balancing either by curtailing generation or increasing consumption (when the frequency is above limit) or adding generation from a control (or spinning) reserve to the grid (when the frequency is below limit), for grid balancing and stabilization.
 
Grid Stabilization During DER Integration
 
•	Distribution Management System Controller Functions
•	The Distribution Management System Controller (DMSC) obtains the grid parameters and sends signals to the devices under its control.

•	Other Key Functions of DMSC
•	DMSC performs state estimation.
•	It detects faults in the system.
•	DMSC calculates optimal control settings using real-time measurements of DER generation, load injections, and power flows in the network.
•	These measurements are used to calculate network operating conditions and load forecast models.
•	Network Operating Conditions Assessment
•	After assessing the network operating conditions, the control algorithm determines whether the network operates within its permissible boundaries.
•	Operating constraints are usually voltage limits and thermal ratings of the power lines and equipment. 
•	Optimal Control in DMSC
•	The optimal control algorithm calculates the required control settings and optimizes the device settings without violating constraints and operating limits. 
•	DMSC sends optimal control schedules to devices connected to the network.
•	Devices include an On-Load Tap Changer (OLTC), a voltage regulator relay, a static VAR compensator (SVC), or an RTU / SCADA / PLC. 
•	These devices perform functions such as voltage regulation, reactive power control, load control, and grid stabilization.
 
Distributed Energy Resources Management System (DERMS)
 
•	Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)
•	Distribution Management System (DMS)
•	Outage Management System (OMS)
•	Enterprise Asset Management (EAM)
•	Workforce Management System (WFM)
DERMS provides grid services specially focused on the location of each aggregated DER asset, for example:
•	Voltage management of the grid
•	Optimization of the power flow within the grid
•	Load management and supply balancing
On the other hand, VPP's are responsible for real-time optimization and control of merit-based generation and grid connections, irrespective of the location of the aggregated DER asset.
The main objectives of a VPP are:

Climate Resilience
 
 
Need For Climate-Resilient Electricity Regulations
 

Smart Grid Regulations: Overview
 
 
Importance of Regulations In Electricity Industry
 
Policy and Regulatory Support For Clean Energy Transition
 
 
•	Clean energy transition is heralding a major structural change to electricity systems, but it also comes with the risks, associated with transforming the traditional power systems.
To address the risks and build long-term energy security, there is a need to create flexible resources, such as dispatchable generation, demand response systems, energy storage, and virtual power plants. 
•	Policy and regulatory support is needed to promote energy diversity using renewable sources, along with grid modernization and energy efficiency measures, with an aim to provide a secure, resilient and affordable power system. 
•	As Variable Renewable Energy (VRE) generation e.g., solar photovoltaic and wind power, become cheaper with advancing technology, the global average annual share of VRE in electricity generation is expected to reach 45% by 2040, as per International Energy Agency (IEA) report.
•	System operators face new challenges associated with energy transition, most important of which is tackling congestions and the need for system balancing and grid stability.  
•	We need regulators to support market-based mechanisms which can provide balancing services at a lower cost and implement systems to dynamically manage energy reserves with shorter pricing intervals. 
•	Policymakers, regulators and system planners formulate policies and regulations, considering all the flexibility options and electricity market operations, to ensure secure, clean and affordable energy transition.
Regulatory Trends In Electricity Digital Transformation
 
•	1

Changes in regulations, policies, and consumer expectations are driving transformation in the electricity sector with increased adoption of smart grid technologies. 
•	2
2
However, electricity utilities also face challenges in integrating innovative digital technologies with the existing legacy infrastructure.
•	3
3
The drive for low-carbon / no-carbon generation technologies, and more energy-efficient systems on the demand side, requires energy users to be more active and have more digital interactions with the grid.
•	4
4
Policies and regulations have to align with the evolving energy landscape and markets to drive technical and commercial improvements, energy efficiency, low carbon transition and sustainability.
•	5
5
Harmonized regulatory and policy frameworks ensure the adoption of shared technical standards and protocols to achieve a sustainable smart grid development.
Smart Grid Policies, Regulations and Investments
 
The major reasons for increased smart grid investment are many, for example:
 
oadmap For Standardization and Interoperability
 
New services and development of technology platforms have increased the deployment of intelligent devices to communicate and interoperate seamlessly in a smart grid implementation. 
This calls for adoption of smart grid technology standards and protocols to achieve the following objectives:
•	1
1
Seamless interoperability
•	2
2
Harmonized data models 
•	3
3
Uniform protocols for communication and information exchange  
•	4
4
Robust information security, data protection and privacy
•	5
5
Improved security, reliability and quality of supply  
Interoperability between different elements of smart grid such as smart metering infrastructure, distributed energy resource (DER), demand response (DR) systems, energy storage, EV charging infrastructure, and remote monitoring and control system, is therefore essential.  
Regulations To Provide Flexibility & Grid Optimization
 
•	Distributed Energy Resources (DER's) comprising mainly the RE sources such as rooftop solar panels and wind turbines offer a clean and efficient way to generate power. 

•	Integrating DER's into the grid have to be compliant with grid regulations and standards. This means updating outdated regulations and standards and developing new models to manage grid connections (including EV loads), bidirectional energy flows and network stability.
•	As more and more consumers switch to Electric Vehicles (EV's), smart grids will need to handle increased demand for energy. Smart charging stations and Vehicle-To-Grid (V2G) technologies will have to work in close coordination to maintain grid discipline, in compliance with the regulatory standards.
•	V2G technologies allow EV's to store energy and feed it back into the grid during peak demand. Through V2G application, EV's can act as reserve energy storage to provide a range of flexibility services.
•	Vehicle-To-Everything (V2X) enables EV's to provide flexibility services beyond the grid, to homes and business, which include demand response and ancillary services to support the grid during peak periods or congestion.
 
Energy regulators encourage the development of RE-powered microgrid, particularly in remote and rural areas, for its multiple benefits, such as:

 

Regulations Are Service-Focused and Customer-Centric 
 
•	Real-time analytics of the energy systems, for better monitoring, control, and optimization of operations, is fundamental to modern smart grids. 


That is why, grid automation and modernization technologies are gaining wider acceptance among the policymakers, energy regulators, system planners and other energy stakeholders, focused on improved services and customer experience. 


Digitalization of smart grid processes has enabled real-time data-driven solutions, complying with local and global energy regulations.


It is also helping in bridging the information gap among system integrators, aggregators, prosumers, markets, and communities, and bringing more value to the customers.


Compliance requirements of electricity regulations on energy transition have prompted the utilities to increase the adoption of distributed energy systems, despite challenges associated with their integration.


Regulatory frameworks are in force in many countries, highlighting the role of TSO's and DSO's in energy transition by facilitating better collaboration among all stakeholders in the electricity value chain to offer better services and value to customers.
•	Regulatory actions in general to support the cost and quality of services, consumer interests, electricity balancing, flexibility services, grid stabilization, network optimization and market operations have become more evident.


The stakeholders are developing new and innovative business models to integrate digitalization in their smart grid development roadmap. 


To meet the regulatory KPI's, it has become necessary for stakeholders to accelerate digitalization for smooth energy transition and sustainable operations, in line with the regulations and specified service standards.


Innovative tools and technologies are being constantly experimented to improve service quality and benefits to customers.


For example, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one such tool increasingly deployed by industry, considering its enormous potential in smart grid management, network optimization, efficiency improvement, cost reduction and improved services - all of which are regulatory priorities. 


AI algorithms can forecast energy demand patterns, predict network faults, optimize power flows, improve reliability and operational efficiency, using real-time grid data.
Regulatory Challenges
 
 
Regulatory Challenges of Distribution System Operations
 
•	With multiple DER's at different locations competing for network connections, managing the grid optimally and maintaining its stability, within the regulatory limits, can be extremely challenging.

Electricity regulators therefore have been incentivizing the Distribution System Operators (DSO's) to innovate and invest in network planning, optimal grid reinforcements and smart grid initiatives.  

The challenge that local regulatory authorities face is to protect consumers from potentially higher electricity charges passed on to them by the DSO's by justifying the cost of investment in smart grid infrastructure.

This becomes even more challenging when the DSO's are state-owned and a source of government revenue.

Therefore, a balancing act is needed between incentivizing DSO's to invest in smart grids and avoiding the imposition of high tariffs on consumers. 
•	Another challenge is a possible conflict of interest between DSO's and prosumers (those who both consume and produce electricity). 

DSOs may be wary of the prosumers affecting their bottom line, due to the economic fallout of suboptimal grid utilization, as the prosumers can rely on their own microgrid, which can be operated independently (in islanded mode) and use the DSO grid electricity only when the microgrid generation is lower or non-existent. 

Regulatory interventions are therefore needed to create an enabling environment, balancing the interests of both the DSO's and the prosumers, so that DSO's are not opposed to the development of technology considering the potential commercial risk.  
Regulatory Challenges of Supply Vs Demand Balancing
 
 
Maintenance of the electricity supply and demand balance can be achieved in two ways:
•	1
1
Via market mechanisms (real-time electricity markets)
•	2
2
By creating adequate dispatchable storage capacity
The low-carbon / net-zero transition is linked to the growth of RE sources, e.g. solar, wind, biomass, etc. Since these are intermittent in nature, we would need energy storage capacity to connect as an ancillary service, to serve the energy demand when RE sources do not generate or underperform.
However, the challenge is that we need large areas to establish solar or wind farms to supply power at grid-scale, to be able to compete with fossil-based generation fuels commercially. 
One way is to have a hybrid RE mix comprising e.g. solar, wind and Battery Energy Storage System (BESS), and manage the resources optimally for continual supply-demand balancing. Another way is to have sophisticated weather forecast tools to assist in predicting the demand with increasing accuracy and minimize uncertainties.
If balancing is not met, it could lead to grid instability which may result in load-shedding (or power cuts) or rise in electricity prices. Load shedding amounts to service breach (failure to provide continuous supply), while electricity price increase may result in energy poverty and unaffordable power, thus violating electricity regulations and customer SLA's. 
To avert such situations, the regulators recommend automated Demand Response (DR) programs, e.g. end-use energy efficiency (demand side management), realistic pricing (market-discoverable), better forecasting, and greater resource flexibility. 
Regulatory Challenges Related To Data Privacy and Protection
 
Another regulatory challenge relates to the use of, and access to, smart meter data for smart grids. 
For example, smart grids in general frequently makes use of and rely on data from the smart meters and the network. 
As per regulations, the electricity utility are expected to clearly define how the consumer meter / energy data will be managed, who will manage it, and how it will be handled, processed and presented, owing to legitimate data privacy concerns.
Authorized access, encryption, secure communication, ownership and safeguarding privacy of meter / energy data are the key challenges. 
While the regulatory nature of data protection for smart grids can be debated, the regulatory bodies continue to play a key role in ensuring privacy and protection of consumer data, in compliance with GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). 
Regulators and policymakers can even learn from the experiences in other industry sectors who had to face similar issues concerning data privacy and protection.
Regulatory Role In Support of Standardization
 
•	Standardization of grid technologies are considered important to improve the security, integrity and interoperability of the systems comprising the smart grid infrastructure.
•	The role of standardization is crucial to identify and plug vulnerabilities in the smart grid ecosystem and protect it from cyberattacks, thus de-risking the critical network infrastructure.
•	Standardization also guards against the use of substandard assets which interfere with seamless interface and integration with the smart grid network and inhibit smooth operations of the network.
•	Standardization also improves safety of the smart grid equipment and maintenance personnel, with the help of proven quality of monitoring, control, and protection systems.
•	While standardization may occur at different levels of a smart grid implementation, covering both ICT and operation technologies, they also tend to increase costs, which are often passed on to consumers. 
•	Energy Regulators will have to take the lead, taking help from industry and research collaboration, to provide an internationally acceptable framework for smart grid standardization which supports network integration, security and interoperability across the systems.
•	The NIST* Framework and Roadmap for Smart Grid Interoperability Standards are widely accepted and followed by the electricity regulators and other electricity stakeholders globally.
Role of Regulations To Overcome Barriers of Energy Transition
 
Energy regulations play an important role in enforcing a transition towards more sustainable, clean and affordable smart grid solutions. However, there are also implementation barriers:
•	1
1
Most technologies, including RE systems, need to attain economies of scale to achieve cost viability. 
•	2
2
Technical specifications have to be clearly established, as per industry standards, to accelerate smart grid deployment.
 
In the case of end-use energy efficiency, the barriers are even more complex. Many energy efficiency technologies and practices, though highly cost-effective, face the following additional barriers:
•	1
1
Lack of awareness of the cost savings potential in energy usage
•	2
2
Partial or missing information on energy efficiency performance 
•	3
3
Absence of common standards for measuring, defining, comparing, reporting and verifying energy efficiency
•	4
4
Lack of consideration of system and process energy efficiency issues
•	5
5
Energy efficiency is often a minor determinant of capital-acquisition decisions  
 
To overcome the barriers of clean energy transition, the regulators need to take the following steps:
•	1
1
Recognize the need for accelerating transition
•	2
2
Formulate policies that encourage all the stakeholders to drive transition
•	3
3
Acknowledge DSO’s role in energy transition and to keep electricity costs affordable 
•	4
4
Incentivize investments, innovation, research and development in clean energy transition 
•	5
5
Define fair tariff to recover maintenance and investment costs, while keeping it affordable
